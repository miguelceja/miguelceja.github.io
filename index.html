          Code, design, and the opportunity to solve tough problems are what get
          me up the morning (that and a

          I&apos;m attracted to projects with a story to tell. A good story can
          connect people to a brand or product, and I enjoy the challenge of
          telling a great story through seamless design and code.

        <h3>Wanna play me in Tic-Tac-Toe? (I'll go easy ðŸ˜‰)</h3>

        <p>Just a little coding challenge I did for funsies.</p>
        <p>
          This was a great reminder to never assume a project will be simple
          based on a simple description. I mean, Tic-Tac-Toe: you have nine
          squares, two players, each player alternates selecting a square until
          one has three in a row. Simple enough.
        </p>
        <p>Right?</p>
        <p>
          I thought, OK, so basically the logic should be: a player clicks on a
          square, then the game automatically chooses an available square after
          that to simulate an opponent, then rinse and repeat until either
          letter has three in a row. Hardest part might be just keeping track of
          the game state after each move. Simple enough.
        </p>
        <p>Right?!</p>
        <p>
          Well, yes, that would satisfy basic game play. But what if we wanted
          to make it more challenging? What if I wanted to detect when the
          player has two in a row - then I should probably add logic to block
          that win. What if the computer has two in a row - I should probably
          add logic to choose the remaining square. And wouldn't it be
          interesting to see at a glance all the turn numbers? Also, if the
          middle square is available, the computer should take it as soon as
          possible since it is the most advantageous square. This is where
          things got fun!
        </p>

        <p>
          I decided to use jQuery just to move faster and focus on the actual
          logic. There are certainly improvements that can be made (and maybe a
          bug or two ðŸ¤£), but not too bad for a fun little coding challenge.
