          I&apos;m attracted to projects with a story to tell. A good story can
          connect people to a brand or product, and I enjoy the challenge of
          telling a great story through seamless design and code.

        <h3>Wanna play me in Tic-Tac-Toe? (I'll go easy ðŸ˜‰)</h3>

        <p>Just a little coding challenge I did for funsies.</p>
        <p>
          This was a great lesson in not judging a project by its description. I
          mean, Tic-Tac-Toe: nine squares, get three in a row, you win. Simple
          enough...
        </p>
        <p>Right?</p>
        <p>
          So I thought, ok, basically logic should be: a player clicks on a
          square, then the "computer" chooses an available square to simulate an
          opponent until either letter has three in a row. Hardest part might be
          just keeping track of the game state, and I'm done...
        </p>
        <p>Right?</p>
        <p>
          Well, yes, that would satisfy basic game play. But what if we wanted
          to make it more challenging? What if I wanted to detect when the
          player has two in a row - then I should probably add logic to block
          that win. What if the computer has two in a row - I should probably
          add logic to choose the remaining square. And wouldn't it be
          interesting to see at a glance all the turn numbers? Also, if the
          middle square is available after the first move, the computer should
          take it since it's the most advantageous square. This is where things
          got fun!
        </p>

        <p>
          I decided to use jQuery just to move faster and focus on the actual
          logic. There are certainly improvements that can be made, but not too
          bad for a fun little coding challenge. Let's play!
