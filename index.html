          I like projects that tell a story. A good story can more effectively
          connect people to a brand or product, and I enjoy the challenge of
          telling a great story through seamless design and code.

          I was inspired after seeing Rich McLaughlin's
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJPAR7Meu3M"
            >Legend of Canvas</a
          >
          presentation on how he recreated the NES
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)"
            >Legend of Zelda</a
          >
          using the Canvas API. Though I didn't have time for something that
          ambitious, especially never having coded a game before, so I wanted to
          start with something simple - and what better game to dip my
          <span class="italic">toes</span> into coding a game than Tic-Tac-<span
            class="italic"
            >Toe</span
          >
          (sorry, I had to).
        </p>
        <p>
          Horrible puns aside, this was a humbling lesson that even the simplest
          of games can have complex logic under the hood. On the surface,
          Tic-Tac-Toe is basically nine squares, two players, and each player
          alternates selecting a square until one gets three in a row.
        </p>
        <p>Simple enough, right?</p>
        <p>
          I thought, OK, so basically the logic should be: a player clicks on a
          square, then the game automatically chooses an available square after
          that to simulate an opponent, then rinse and repeat until either
          letter has three in a row. I assumed the hardest part would just be
          keeping track of the game state after each move.
        </p>
        <p>Simple enough, right?</p>
        <p>
          Actually, yes, that simple logic would satisfy basic game play and you
          could call it a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I knew it could be better. Having the computer/opponent choose a
          random square, while it did occasionally create a challenging game,
          just wasn't challenging enough. So I started thinking about what I
          wanted from the game as a player to make it more fun and challenging.
          For example:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            What if I wanted to detect when a player has two in a row? Then I
            should probably add logic so that the computer blocks that win.
          </li>
          <li>
            What if the computer has two in a row? I should probably add logic
            to have the computer choose the remaining square in that row over
            other available squares.
          </li>
          <li>
            And wouldn't it be interesting to see at a glance what order squares
            were chosen?
          </li>
          <li>
            Also, if the middle square is available, the computer should take it
            as soon as possible since it is the most advantageous square.
          </li>
          <li>
            And if we're going to the trouble of adding all this functionality,
            it should probably look decent.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This is where things got fun and interesting! I also decided to use
          jQuery just to move faster and focus on the actual logic and design.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are definitely further improvements to be made (and likely a bug
          or two to fix ü§£). But not too bad for a fun little side project.
